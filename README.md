# Assignment 8

In this assignment you will implement dfs() and bfs() on a graph using an adjacency list with our Stack and Queue classes from the last assignment. In addition, you will answer some conceptual questions.

## Basic Instructions

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top of the page
2. Add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on your **private** repository.
3. Implement the missing parts where it says "YOUR CODE HERE"
4. Test it on your local computer by following the build directions below
5. Push your code to GitHub. Every push will be automatically tested through a GitHub Action.
6. Answer the questions in `questions.txt` in your own file, `answers.txt`.
7. Submit the URL to your private repository on Canvas.

## Provided Files

@files you should modify

- `README.md` this file
- `LICENSE` MIT License
- `sequential_collection.py` the superclass of Queue and Stack
- `stack.py` implementation of Stack
- `que.py` implementation of Queue
- `graph.py` @ Graph that contains dfs() and bfs()
- `tests.py` the unit tests to prove your code works
- `questions.txt` the questions for you to answer

## Testing

You can run all of the unit tests in the current directory by running:

```
python -m unittest discover
```

You can also run tests.py directly:

```
python tests.py
```
